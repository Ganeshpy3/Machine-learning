# Simple linear regression 
> When our dependent variable  is  linear  and our feature of independent value is one we use simple linear regression
## Formula 
 - Least Square Method

       Y=M*X+C
        
        where as ,
             M   -Slope
             C   -Intercept
    
    
               Î£((X-X_mean)*(Y-Y_mean)) 
       M  =  _________________________ 
                  Î£(X-X_mean)^2 
             
             
       where as,
          X      -Independent variable 
          X_mean -Mean of Independent variable 
          Y      -Dependent variable 
          Y_mean -Mean of dependent variable 


        C=Y-M*X
     
     
  - Normal equation
         
         theta=(X*X.T)^-1*(X.T*Y)
         
         where as ,
              X  -Independent variable 
              Y  -Dependent variable 
              
              
### Metrics 
   R Squared
      R-squared is a statistical measure of how close the data are to the fitted regression line. It is also known as the coefficient of determination, or the coefficient of           multiple determination for multiple regression.
